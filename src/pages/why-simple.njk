    <h1>Why Simple Works Better</h1>
    <p>
      The pet industry wants you to believe more ingredients means better
      performance. The truth? Cats have been just fine with simple solutions
      for thousands of years.

        <h2>The Case for Simplicity</h2>
        <p>
          Walk down any pet store aisle and you'll see litters promising
          "advanced odor technology," "revolutionary formulas," and
          "scientifically engineered" solutions. But here's what the marketing
          doesn't tell you: cats don't need any of that.
        </p>
        <p>
          For millions of years, cats have been burying waste in sand, soil,
          and natural materials. Their instincts are finely tuned to simple,
          unscented substances. When we overcomplicate litter, we're solving
          problems that don't exist—and often creating new ones.
        </p>

        <h3>What Cats Actually Need</h3>
        <p>
          A cat's requirements are straightforward: something that absorbs
          moisture, allows digging, and doesn't assault their sensitive noses.
          Natural materials like clay, wood, and plant fibers have been meeting
          these needs perfectly for generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The "innovations" in many modern litters—artificial fragrances,
          synthetic crystals, chemical additives—are designed to appeal to
          humans, not cats. And often, these additions make the litter box
          less appealing to your feline companion.
        </p>

        <h3>The Fragrance Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Cats have approximately 200 million scent receptors compared to our
          5 million. What smells pleasant to us can be overwhelming—even
          nauseating—to them. Strong fragrances in litter are one of the top
          reasons cats avoid their boxes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simple litters control odor through absorption, not masking. Natural
          materials like activated charcoal, clay, and certain plant fibers
          trap odor molecules rather than covering them with perfume.
        </p>

        <h3>Health Considerations</h3>
        <p>
          The fewer ingredients in your cat's litter, the fewer potential
          irritants they're exposed to. Cats groom themselves constantly,
          meaning anything that sticks to their paws ends up ingested. Simple,
          natural ingredients are generally safer if accidentally consumed.
